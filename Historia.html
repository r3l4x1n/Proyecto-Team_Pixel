          The character of Hulk was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, and first appeared in <a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/8906/incredible_hulk_1962_1" target="_blank"> Incredible Hulk #1</a> comic book in 1962. The story follows the physicist Bruce Banner, who is exposed to a blast of gamma radiation
          while trying to save a young man from the detonation of an experimental bomb. The exposure transforms Banner
          into the monstrous and incredibly powerful creature known as the Hulk.
          At first, Banner transforms into the Hulk only when he is under great stress or anger, but as the story
          progresses, the transformation becomes more difficult to control, and he changes into the Hulk more and more
          frequently. The Hulk possesses incredible strength, endurance, and regenerative abilities, but he is often
          depicted as being childlike and prone to fits of rage.
          Throughout the comics, the Hulk battles a variety of villains, including the military, other superheroes, and
          various supervillains. He has also been a member of the Avengers and other superhero teams, but his tendency
          towards destructive behavior often causes friction with his allies.
          The character has been adapted into various movies and TV shows, with notable portrayals by actors such as Lou
          Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo. The character's popularity has endured for decades,
          making him one of the most iconic and recognizable superheroes in popular culture.
