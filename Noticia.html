        Biografía Mark Ruffalo:
        Mark Ruffalo is an American actor and activist born on November 22, 1967 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He began his
        acting career in theater in New York City, where he participated in several Off-Broadway productions before
        making the leap to film in the 1990s.


        Ruffalo became known for his roles in films such as "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (2004), "Zodiac"
        (2007), and "The Kids Are All Right" (2010). But it was his portrayal of Bruce Banner/Hulk in the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe that made him a globally recognized star.

        In addition to his acting career, Ruffalo is a committed activist for various social and political causes,
        including fighting climate change, advocating for clean water, and supporting the LGBTQ+ community. He is also a
        proponent of public healthcare in the United States and has worked on political campaigns for civil rights.

        In 2010, Ruffalo received his first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role in "The Kids Are All
        Right." He has also been nominated for several Emmy Awards for his television work. In 2014, he won the Emmy
        Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries for his role in "The Normal Heart."

        In his personal life, Ruffalo has been married to actress Sunrise Coigney since 2000 and they have three
        children together. He currently resides in New York, where he continues his acting career and political and
        social activism.
